# Back From Winter Break Activities

## Lesson 2: More Java (Control Flow & Methods)

### Print Multiples

Create a method called printMultiples(int multiple, n).
The method should print out the multiples of m, n - times

### Print Factors (harder)

Create a method called printFactors(int n).
The method should print out all of the factors that n has.

## Lesson 3: Object Oriented Programming

### Cake

Create a class called cake that has the String flavor, a boolean called dairy-free,
and another boolean called pieIsBetter. Initialize all of the variables in the constructor.
Create a bunch of instances of the cake class, each with various values for each of the variables

### Segways Are Cool

Create a class called transportation. The class should have integer variables topSpeed, wheels, and passenger number, and a constructor where you can initialize all of the variables. Make other classes that extend the transportation class, based off of vehicles, and add variables based off the unique qualities that each transportation has eg, if you make a segway, you can add a variable called coolness factor. Also make sure to set the values of the variables in the super class.

## Lesson 5: Robot Programming

### Spinning Claw Of Doom

Note: This is basically an arm, except with a spinning claw on top of it. Think General Greivous from Star Wars.

Create a subsystem called the spinning claw of doom.
The claw has 2 motors, and one for the elbow, and one that rotates the giant claw (ports 1 & 2).
The claw has 1 solenoid that controls whether the claw is opened or closed (port 0).

There should be methods to open and close the claw. The elbows should be controlled by the joysticks, and you should print the encoder values to SmartDashboard.

The spinning motor on the claw is controlled by 2 buttons. One makes it turn at a speed of 0.5, and the other should make it turn at a speed of -0.1.
