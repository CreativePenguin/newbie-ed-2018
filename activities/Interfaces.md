## Activity
> Example [interface](https://github.com/Team694/newbie-ed-2019/tree/master/examples/ChessPiece.java) and [child class](https://github.com/Team694/newbie-ed-2019/tree/master/examples/Queen.java)
Create an interface called chess piece. There should be a method that returns a description of the piece, and a method that returns the point value. The interface should be overriden with classes for each of the chess pieces.
