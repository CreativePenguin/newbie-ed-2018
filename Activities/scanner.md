### CHALLENGE: Make Your Own RPG
>We may or may not do this as a class

Make a short RPG involving a fight with a monster. Make sure to include a backstory, and give the users options on how they should react to the monster. Include different scenarios that play out based on the user's choice. It should also return error messages if the user doesn't give a viable response. For extra credit, give the action a percentage of failing.
```
<comp> You're on your way to take the SHSAT, but a monster blocks the path!
[1] Run
[2] Insult
[3] Pikachu
<user> 2
<comp> You call the monster's mother fat. The monster is offended, and starts crying. Congratulations, you have defeated the monster and may now advance to take the SHSAT.
