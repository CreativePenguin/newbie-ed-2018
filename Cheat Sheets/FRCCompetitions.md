# Guide to how FRC competitions Work

### Need To Know Vocab
Alliance: A group of three robots that are on the same team.

Practice Matches: These are the first matches ever played. They happen during the end of the second day and they have no bearing on the rankings.

Qualification Matches: These are matches that randomly pair up three teams against each other. Depending on what happens in the match, robots will earn ranking points.

Alliance Selection: After qualification matches, the top 8 teams choose other teams to be on their alliance for Eliminations matches. See Alliance Selection section.

Eliminations Matches: These are matches between alliances that robots choose. Each alliance needs 2 wins in order to move on to the next round.(quaterfinals->semifinals->finals)

Opening Ceremony: This is an event in the beginning of Day 3. They play the National Anthem at the beginning of the day, and some people get up to speak.

Regionals: This is the lowest level of competition, matching up all the teams in the general area. Winning here will qualify you for championship.

Championship: This is a world championship, exclusive only to teams that qualified. The teams are divided up equally into divisions, and each division follows the same format as a regional.

Einstein: This is the highest round of competition that matches the winners of every division against each other. The quarter finals are in a round robin style, and the 2 teams with the highest RP will move on to finals.

Scouting: Watching robot matches and taking notes of what each robot is capable of so that we can form strategies to work with or against them.

Gracious Professionalism: This means to always be kind and respectful to other people at the competition, and to help out other teams when they have mechanical issues

## Regionals
### Day 1
The first day is when you set up the pit. This involves unpacking the robot and putting up the banners. There is a limit of 5 people, so newbies are usually not involved in this.
### Day 2
The second day consists of robot inspections and practice matches. This is where we reassemble the robot, finish setting up the pit, and make sure that everything is in working order.
### Day 3
The third day is when the qualification matches start. There's the opening ceremony in the morning, and then after that are qualification matches. They run on for the whole day with a break in the middle for lunch. Most people will be scouting the matches. Strategists will probably hold a training session to explain what you should look for while scouting.
### Day 4
Starts with an opening ceremony as well, though it is much shorter than the previous day. This day will finish up the quals matches, and hold alliance selection right before lunch, and eliminations matches directly after. After the eliminations matches are over comes the awards ceremony.
### Seed Order
The final rankings are determined by whoever has the most ranking points. 2 ranking points for a win, 1 for a tie, and 0 for a loss. You can also earn 2 extra ranking points by completing certain tasks in the game. If 2 teams are tied in ranking points, then the team that won the most points through game tasks will be ranked higher.
### Alliance Selection
When teams pick their alliances, the highest seeded robot goes first. However, when teams pick their second robot, the lowest seeded robot goes first.

If a team chooses another alliance in the top 8, and the other robot accepts, then all of the robots ranked below the robot that was just chosen will move up a spot.

If a team rejects the offer of another team to join their alliance, they cannot be picked by another team, eg if the number 3 rank team rejects the number 1 rank team. They cannot be picked by rank 2.

### Qualifying for Champs
How to qualify for champs:
- Win the regional
- Wildcard - When a team double qualifies, they qualify another team to go to the champs. If that team is already qualified then the process repeats. Finalist captain -> finalist first pick -> finalist second pick. After finalist robots all qualify, no more wildcards are generated.
- Chairman's award - This is awarded to teams that contribute the most to their community, and do their best to spread FIRST ideals
- Rookie All Star Award - Awarded to the rookie team that does the best at following FIRST ideas.
- Engineering Inspiration - Awarded to team that helps spread engineering throughout their school.
- Hall of Fame - After winning the Chairman's Award at a championship level, you enter the hall of fame, and are invited to champs every year.
