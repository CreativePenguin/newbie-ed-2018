## Java Resources
> For those that are hoping to sharpen their coding skillz
> Note that most of these tutorials use Java 8. You will not be dealing with things complex enough that there will be a significant difference between Java 8 and Java 11.
> All of these tutorials go beyond the amount that we expect you to know, so don't fret if there's something you don't understand.

- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm) If you know everything up to Object Oriented, you're fine (if you don't know everything up to Object Oriented you're probably also fine)
- [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) 
- [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) Note that this one goes way beyond what we expect you to know
